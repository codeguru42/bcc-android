Interacting with the API is usually a fairly simple task, but overcoming that first hurdle of authenticating via OAuth can be difficult if you&#39;re unfamiliar with it! Particularly if you don&#39;t have access to your own web server to easily complete the multi-legged flow of the OAuth 2.0 authentication process.</p>\n<p>In this session we&#39;ll discuss what OAuth 2.0 is and why and how it is used. We&#39;ll also go through a real world example of using OAuth2.0 to obtain a token and we&#39;ll do it all using common command-line tools. This session is targeted at students and developers with 1-3 years of experience and some basic understanding of web application development.</p>"

Organizations can better enable their data science teams by building up a robust software ecosystem around their Hadoop platform.  Data scientists need flexibility and choice to create effective workflows.  This talk will describe how organizations can make their data scientists as effective as possible by thinking more broadly about their big data software portfolios.  Self service data provisioning systems, real time ingest and alerting platforms, central data cataloging strategies, and other complimentary storage platforms will be discussed.  An emphasis will be placed on building effective data science workflows through the use of software tools centered around an enterprise Hadoop storage and computing environment.</p>"

It received one of the highest evaluation scores at the world\u2019s biggest code camp.</p>\n<p>This session is designed to give you a solid understanding of underpinnings and principles of Hadoop, perhaps the most sought after high-paying skill for a developer today. The in-depth session will begin by illustrating on how you build your own single node cluster of Hadoop on the Linux virtual machine (CentOS) for free so you can start learning immediately.</p>\n<p>The session will begin with a raw Linux VM and all the needed components will be downloaded and installed. You can be up and running quickly in the cloud within 30 minutes. This session will contain code and will show no more than a few slides.</p>\n<p>We will learn about writing the low-level map/reduce code in Java, which is really the assembly language of Hadoop code. From there we will introduce more efficient approaches to analyzing big data with Hadoop, running high level queries and analyzing crime information from San Francisco as the example. We will create tables, import data, and group crime types all with a simple SQL like interface that is Hive.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will include a brief talk on PIG as well to round out the high level programming models and additional follow up materials so you can be up to speed on one of the most promising and financially rewarding skills today.</p>"

At the end of four weeks, most of our families has soldered a robot brain, made a robot body, and programmed their new robot to follow a line. The class was made more affordable by the donations we received.

We will show you how D3 allows the developer, using a data-driven approach, to bind arbitrary data to Document Object Model (DOM) elements, and then apply transformations to the document with powerful visualization components. D3 is known to be fast, robust, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. With an emphasis on web standards, D3 gives the developer full capabilities of modern browsers without tying your project to a proprietary framework, allowing flexibility to build a data visualization framework you want. The session will also demonstrate how to rapidly prototype data visualization using an experimental development environment.</p>"

The traditional approach (infrastructure as a service) is to create and set up VM\u2019s. This approach allows you to install just about anything on a machine running in the data center. But is somewhat of a manual process and doesn\u2019t scale that easily. A better approach is to leverage the technology known as, platform as a service, which allows developers to focus on the application and its data, not on the underlying infrastructure, which is abstracted away with this approach. Anyone that claims to know cloud computing needs to understand the pros and cons of each architectural approach. This session will provide concrete examples and demonstrations of how it all works and ties together. Anyone looking for a career in the cloud will be very well served by understanding the underpinnings presented in this session.</p>"

They don&#39;t even seem to notice that 90% of these type of searches fail! Fortunately, a developer turned researcher did notice, and has dedicated the better part of the last decade to eliminating this quiet productivity-killer.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I&#39;ll use both video examples and a massive repository of real developer activity data to prove that the typically-used regex searches waste a significant part of your day.  Yet this talk won&#39;t dwell on the past; it focuses squarely on a better search future. I&#39;ll provide a tour of Visual Studio&#39;s many built in searches, demonstrate two search tools available as extensions, and provide guidelines for better searching. By attending this talk you will become a more effective searcher, a skill that is surprisingly fundamental to software development, and I estimate you can eliminate 10-30% waste from an average sprint.</p>"
